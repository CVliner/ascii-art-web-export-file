### Objectives

You must follow the same principles as the first subject.

Ascii-art-web-export consists on making sure that it is possible to export the output of the web application, at least in one export format at your choice.

    You should be able to export the result of the ascii-art project implemented in the website.
    The file must be exported with the right permissions (read and write) for the user.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (www). When sending a file or image as part of the HTTP response we must include the use of HTTP headers.

Headers used for file transfer are Content-Type, Content-Length and Content-Disposition and more if needed, but for this project you will be obligated to use those headers.

### Instructions

    As you already learned from the previous project you must create a new HTTP endpoint to be able to transfer the file to the client. The following instructions must also be followed :

    The web server must export at least in one export format.
    The web server must be created in Go.
    The web site must include a button or a link to download/export the file.
    You must handle website errors.
    The code must respect the good practices.
